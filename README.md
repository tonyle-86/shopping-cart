## Possible improvements for the future
The application currently does not respond to the size of the screen. Adding styles for multiple breakpoints would improve the viewing experience of users across several devices.

The application is using hardcoded strings for its content. Ideally this should be coming from a config somewhere so that they is one source of truth for the content.

## Other scripts
`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
